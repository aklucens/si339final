                <img src="images/family.jpeg" alt="Anna's Mom and Dad in a gondola in Venice">
                <p>I grew up in a household where cultural exploration was a prioritization. With my mom's background as a child of Chinese immigrants, I found myself immersed in Asian culture. With my dad's background as a child of Lithuanian immigrants, I grew up with a unique perspective on an Eastern European heritage. </p>

                <img src="images/passion.jpeg" alt="Eiffel Tower in Paris at sunset">
                <p>Fostering this sense of cultural awareness won’t come easy, but turning the challenges into opportunities for continued learning will be the most rewarding experience. I will continue my cultural curiosity, from questions about the best traditional food to cultural traditions and customs to follow. I want to make the most of my experience in this program, challenging myself to live in the moment, value perseverance, and be courageous in all of my international endeavors.</p>

        <p> Hey there, welcome to my blog! 
        <p> It's not just about tips and tricks—it's also about having a good time! I'm here to help you get the most out of your travels, whether that means knowing when to splurge, how to save, or sharing some of the quirky things I've learned along the way. And of course, you can expect some funny stories, random thoughts, and awesome travel pics.</p>
        <p>Like everyone else, I have my ups and downs, but I promise to keep it real, with a healthy dose of humor. Readers often tell me, "You're so honest," and I love that. My goal is to make sure you have the most amazing trips possible, and that starts with being truthful. Choosing a life of travel has been one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'm thrilled to have you along for the ride.</p>
